# Exercise 6: Maven Site Documentation

## Steps Required to Generate Maven Site Documentation

To generate Maven Site documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Configure the `pom.xml` file**  
   Add plugins such as `maven-site-plugin` to the `pom.xml` file.

2. **Create a `site.xml` file**  
   Define the site structure using a `site.xml` file.

3. **Add custom Markdown pages**  
   Place your Markdown documentation files in the `src/site/markdown` directory.

4. **Generate the documentation**  
   Run the following commands in the terminal:

   ```bash
   mvn test
   mvn site
   ```


## Configuration Aspects in `site.xml` and `pom.xml`

### `site.xml`

- Defines the structure and navigation of the Maven Site.
- Specifies menu items and links to custom pages, such as Markdown files.
- Configures the site's title, skin, and other visual aspects.

### `pom.xml`

- Includes plugins like `maven-site-plugin`, `maven-javadoc-plugin`, and `jacoco-maven-plugin` for generating site documentation, Javadoc, and test coverage reports.
- Defines project metadata, such as name, description, and URL of the Git repository.
- Specifies developer information, including names and roles.
- Manages dependency versions to ensure compatibility with the Java version used.

## Additional Configuration Details

- Created `site.xml` in `src/site` to define the site menu, including links to the Introduction page and `good_style.html`.
- Added `good_style.md` in `src/site/markdown` to document best practices for code comments and Git commit messages, integrated via `site.xml`.
